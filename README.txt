Requirements:
	Fairly recent Blender 2.5 build

Docs:
	Getting Started: http://stokes.dyndns.org/redmine/projects/bgui/wiki/Getting_Started

Other than the "Getting Started", there currently isn't much in terms of documentation. I've tried to keep the
source well commented, and I've provided a simple demo in the examples folder.
